# Introduction

I aim to understand LSTM from scratch by following the proposed modified framework by [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850) on a power forecasting challenge. The dataset was already used in [my previous project](https://github.com/MehemmedMehdiPY/Mission-2030-Hackathon-Project) as a theoretically estimated power in Azerbaijan, post-processed on the raw data from [National Solar Renewable Database (NSRDB)](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/). 

The data will be available after the project is fully finished.

Please, see **training_results** folder to get to know about earliest results. At the moment, I trained a small model to ensure the training flow. Therefore, underfitting occurs.
